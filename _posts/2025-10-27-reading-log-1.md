**Key ideas:**  
- Overview of major cortical regions involved in language (STG, MTG, IFG).  
- Auditory-to-linguistic processing routes set the stage for speech perception tasks.

**Why it matters:**  
I’m mapping how early auditory processing relates to ERP components (N1/P2), which aligns with neurolinguistic studies I plan to follow.

**Next:**  
Read Ch.3–4 and sketch a simple flowchart linking acoustic cues → brain regions → behavioral measures.
